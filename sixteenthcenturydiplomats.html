                    <p>In the last twenty years, our understanding of early modern European and French diplomacy and foreign policy has advanced significantly. Historians have dug into the daily practices of diplomats and go-betweens that held foreign relations together. Through this research, the idea that resident ambassadors formed the <i>sine qua non</i> of diplomacy has fallen by the wayside.<sup><a href="#FN1" id="r1" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See M. S. Anderson, The Origins of the Modern European State System, 1494-1618 (Longman, 1998); and Garrett Mattingly, Renaissance Diplomacy (Cosimo Classics, 2009), for the traditional diplomatic history that held the resident ambassador in this capacity; J. Watkins, “Toward a New Diplomatic History of Medieval and Early Modern Europe,” Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 38, no. 1 (January 1, 2008): 1–14, provides a criticism of this more narrow approach to diplomatic history.">1</a></sup> Non-traditional actors such as dragomans, enslaved individuals, women, and espionage networks of lower members of court all participated in diplomatic endeavors in different capacities.<sup><a href="#FN2" id="r2" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sowerby and Hennings, Practices of Diplomacy in the Early Modern World c.1410-1800 (2017); “Cross-Confessional Diplomacy and Diplomatic Intermediaries in the Early Modern Mediterranean,” eds. van Gelder and Krstic, special issue, Journal of Early Modern History 19 (2015); Dursteler, Venetians in Constantinople: Nation, Identity, and Coexistence in the Early Modern Mediterranean (2006); Adams and Cox, Diplomacy and Early Modern Culture (2010); Biedermann, Gerritsen, and Riello, Global Gifts: The Material Culture of Diplomacy in Early Modern Eurasia (2018); Raeymaekers and Derks, The Key to Power?: The Culture of Access in Princely Courts, 1400-1750 (2016).">2</a></sup> Broadening our understanding of these individuals has not diminished the importance of the resident ambassador, but it has demonstrated a more expansive world of diplomatic connectivity.<sup><a href="#FN3" id="r3" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Dursteler, <i>Venetians in Constantinople</i>; Isom-Verhaaren, Allies with the Infidel: The Ottoman and French Alliance in the Sixteenth Century (2011); Talbot, British-Ottoman Relations, 1661-1807: Commerce and Diplomatic Practice in Eighteenth-Century Istanbul (2017); Hernán, Ferrer, and Matthee, eds., The Spanish Monarchy and Safavid Persia in the Early Modern Period: Politics, War and Religion (2016); Kolodziejczyk, The Crimean Khanate and Poland Lithuania: International Diplomacy on the European Periphery (15th-18th century) A Study of Peace Treaties Followed by Annotated Documents (2011).">3</a></sup> Although our knowledge of the world of the ambassador and others working in the production and implementation of foreign policy has grown, we have yet to re-evaluate the expanse of the Europe's, or in this case France's, geo-political world of operations.</p>

                    <p>This chapter will begin to sketch out that world as it related to France in the sixteenth century by mapping the locations of French diplomats over time,<sup><a href="#FN4" id="r4" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The data in these maps is based on  Vindry, Les ambassadeurs français permanents au XVIe siècle (1903), combined with my own research on letters.">4</a></sup> but we must be careful not to consider these embassies as the ultimate answer to our question. Historians in recent years have made it clear that residential embassies were not the sole, or even most prominent, aspect of early modern diplomacy. Throughout the early modern period, intermittent temporary ambassadors with short-term missions remained the rule.<sup><a href="#FN5" id="r5" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Jeremy Black, A History of Diplomacy (London: Reaktion Books, 2010), 47-48.">5</a></sup> This was also the case for France outside of its diplomatic nucleus. A patchwork of hundreds or even thousands of small states punctuated by a few large states comprised early modern Europe.<sup><a href="#FN6" id="r6" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Lipp, Noble Strategies in an Early Modern Small State: The Mahuet of Lorraine (2011), 12.">6</a></sup> Temporary diplomatic agents were central to maintaining connections with all these principalities. Even relatively large Principalities like Genoa, Ferrara, Tuscany, and Savoy never housed a permanent resident ambassador from France beyond intermittent appointments. The same can be said of Poland-Lithuania&mdash;one of the largest territorial states of the region&mdash;until the 1570s when the kingdom became important to French interests because the French crown sought to place Charles IX’s brother Henri, duke of Anjou, on its throne. The majority of European principalities never received a resident ambassador from France. Moreover, it was not unprecedented for France to receive ambassadors without reciprocating. Florence, for instance, sent an ambassador to France in the 1550s that was not reciprocated except with short temporary agents tasked with acquiring loans for France. Scotland also maintained an ambassador in France in the second half of the sixteenth century that was not reciprocated.<sup><a href="#FN7" id="r7" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Jensen, “Catherine de Medici and Her Florentine Friends,” Sixteenth Century Journal 9, no. 2 (1978): 60-63; Jensen, “French Diplomacy and the Wars of Religion,” Sixteenth Century Journal 5, no. 2 (1974): 41.">7</a></sup> </p>

                    <p>Moverover, as we will see in Parts I-IV, the presence of residential ambassadors did not necessarily represent France's foreign-policy priorities at any particular point in time&mdash;indeed, not even for large spans of time. It is perfectly conceivable that an ambassador in one particular location could for significant portions of time operate as a conduit of information for the French court while receiving very little attention from the court. Whereas a temporary envoy&mdash;or even a state lacking any diplomatic representative from France&mdash;could receive significant attention from French rulers represented by a copious correspondence.</p>  

                    <p>Nevertheless, by analyzing French diplomats sent abroad&mdash;where they were located and when&mdash;we can begin to evaluate a rough sketch of France's diplomatic priorities. Diplomats and embassies were an expensive endeavor. Even sending letters through a dedicated courier, rather than the regular postal network that existed across Europe<sup><a href="#FN8" id="r8" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See Allen, Post and Courier Service in the Diplomacy of Early Modern Europe (2012), for more on this network.">8</a></sup>&mdash;could prove expensive. For instance, Henri III chastised his ambassador in Constantinople for wasting money doing just that.<sup><a href="#FN9" id="r9" data-toggle="popover" data-content="S. A. Skilliter, ed., William Harborne and the Trade with Turkey, 1578-1582: A Documentary Study of the First Anglo-Ottoman Relations (New York: Oxford University Press, 1977), 129.">9</a></sup> The investment in these offices across Europe and the Mediterranean thus represented an infrastructure of France's foreign policy. By arranging these embassies by total years present&mdash;for instance, two ambassadors, not including their retinues, present during one year, produce a value of two for that year&mdash;we can visualize the growth and changes this infrastructure experienced over time. This chapter will show that the foundations of this infrastructure that carried France through the rest of the sixteenth century were formed relatively late by about 1535. The concentration of French ambassadors throughout the period formed an axis splitting Europe in half from England along the Swiss Cantons through the Italian principalities and to the Ottoman Empire. This axis formed the nucleus of France's foreign-policy infrastructure&mdash;and thus a set of structural interests&mdash;that persisted throughout the sixteenth century.</p><br>
                    
                    <h4 id="earlystages" style="padding-top:50px; margin-top: -50px;">Early Stages under François I<sup>er</sup> (r. 1515-1547)</a></h4>

                    <p>France began establishing residential embassies in earnest under François I<sup>er</sup> (r. 1515-1547), and French embassies expanded dramatically therafter. <span class="action" id="1516">In 1516,</span> one year after François I<sup>er</sup> (r. 1515-1547) ascended to the throne, France only had two residential ambassadors abroad, located at the courts of England and Venice. <span class="action" id="1547">When François I<sup>er</sup> died in 1547,</span> France maintained at least ten ambassadors in residence across Europe. The diplomatic expansion was truly dramatic. The diplomatic framework François I<sup>er</sup> established formed the basic paramaters by which his successors shaped their own foriegn policy.</p>

                    <p>If François I<sup>er</sup> was the father of France's residential embassy program, it developed more as an <i>ad hoc</i> response to circumstances than any specific plan. For instance, <span class="action" id="1515-1520">in the first five years of his reign,</span> France's diplomatic activity was sporatic at best. Other than Venice, French diplomats rarely spent long in any one location, and they were not spread very far from France: England, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice were their only location. If we consider the circumstances surrounding these early diplomatic missions, their <i>ad hoc</i> nature becomes even more apparent. During this period, one of the two ambassadors sent to England, Guillaume Gouffier de Bonnivet, was sent to establish an alliance in 1518. The next year he was sent to the Holy Roman Empire along with Charles Guillart and the Seigneur d'Oval to procure&mdash;albeit unsuccessfully&mdash;François I<sup>er</sup> the election to the imperial throne.<sup><a href="#FN10" id="r10" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Barrillon, Journal de Jean de Barrillon (1899), ii:120-121.">10</a></sup> In other words, four out of the twelve years of diplomatic presence represented on this map were short-term mission-centered appointments. Even after war broke out in 1521 between François I<sup>er</sup> and Charles V&mdash;the man elected to the Imperial throne and incidentally also the king of Spain, prince of the Netherlands, and ruler of much of Italy&mdash;France's diplomatic network grew slowly. <span class="action" id="1520-1525">During the next five years from 1520 to 1525,</span> France added two more embassies in the Swiss Cantons and in Portugal. These locations reflect the war against Charles V. Swiss mercenaries were a central aspect of France's military, and the French had to maintain constant relations with them to ensure a ready supply of mercenaries.<sup><a href="#FN11" id="r11" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Potter, Renaissance France at War: Armies, Culture and Society, c.1480-1560 (2008), 125-131.">11</a></sup> Considering the importance of the Swiss to the French military, French kings had been sending diplomats there, but they represented short missions, rarely lasting more than six months, and more times than not lasting only one month.<sup><a href="#FN12" id="r12" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Rott, Histoire de la représentation diplomatique de la France auprès des cantons suisses de leurs alliés et de leurs confédérés, (1900), i:1-274.">12</a></sup> The appointment of Louis Daugerant to reside there represented a new policy. Similarly, establishing an embassy in Portugal represented an effort to surround Spain </p>
                    
                    <p>For instance, <span class="action" id="1515-1525">between 1515 and 1525,</span> France maintained only twenty-two total years of ambassadorial presence in six different states.</p> <br>

                    <p>France’s diplomatic network only grew from there. <span class="action" id="1515-1535">In the twenty years before 1535,</span> France did not have a single year during which ten separate ambassadors were dispatched. <span class="action" id="1535-1555">In the twenty years after 1535,</span> there were fifteen. The axis on which this network centered extended from England to Switzerland, Venice, and the Ottoman Empire–the four states most densely populated with French diplomats.</p>
                    <p>In 1559, the conflict between France and the Habsburgs came to an end with the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. Shortly thereafter, a series of religious civil wars broke out in 1562, dominating French concerns until they ended in 1629.<sup><a href="#FN11" id="r11" data-toggle="popover" data-placement= "top" data-content="On these wars, see Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629, 2nd ed. (2005); Sandberg, Warrior Pusuits: Noble Culture and Civil Conflict in Early Modern France (2010).">11</sup></a> Naturally, these wars have caused many historians to focus on France’s domestic concerns during the second half of the sixteenth century. Three diplomatic events have drawn historians’ attention during this period: various marriage negotiations between French princes and Queen Elizabeth of England; support extended to the Dutch as they revolted against Habsburg Spain; and the election of Henry of Valois to the Polish throne.<sup><a href="#FN12" id="r12" data-toggle="popover" data-placement= "top" data-content="Holt, The Duke of Anjou and the Politique Struggle during the Wars of Religion, (1986); Sutherland, The Massacre of St Bartholomew and the European Conflict 1559-1572 (1973); Champion, Henri III, Roi de Pologne (1943). An exception to this characterization is Welch, A Theater of Diplomacy, International Relations and the Performing Arts in Early Modern France (2017), which considers the later sixteenth century in chap. 1; also see Jensen, “French Diplomacy and the Wars of Religion,” 23–46.">12</sup></a>  Beyond this instance, French diplomacy during this period remains relatively unexplored. Nevertheless, as Figures 4-6 indicate, the French court maintained a robust diplomatic network in place. Moreover, the same diplomatic axis remained in place despite dramatically different international circumstances following 1559.</p>
