Similarly, sections are likely to be modified.

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">About This Project</h3>
                    <p>In 1494, the kind of France, Charles VIII (r. 1483-1498), marched his army into the Italian peninsula to conquer Naples, which fell under Spain’s sovereignty to fulfill Charles VIII’s claim to the throne. The king’s actions set off a series of wars across Europe and the Mediterranean known as the Italian Wars (1494-1559). Almost all countries of the region were involved, including France, Spain, England, the Low Countries, the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the various Italian principalities, to name the most prominent states involved. This explosion of multi-continental war was a catalyst for a dramatic increase in French diplomacy and the development of a network of ambassadors scattered across Europe and the Mediterranean region in order to navigate the numerous alliances that permeated the conflict. For instance, France maintained one permanent ambassador abroad in 1515 but had established at least ten by 1547. France’s diplomatic outreach only expanded after 1559 as France navigated a series of crises until 1714: a series of religious civil wars in France from 1562 to 1629, France’s entrance into the Thirty Years War from 1630 until 1648, another civil war in France known as The Fronde from 1648 to 1659, and finally the wars of Louis XIV from 1661 to 1714. Throughout these conflicts, the Franco-Spanish rivalry played a prominent role in shaping their trajectories, and France's diplomatic network provided an essential tool for the French court to navigate these challenges as well as counter the threat Spain's influence compounded onto them. The end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1714 represented the end of an epoch as Louis XIV placed a member of his Bourbon dynasty on the Spanish throne, cementing the transition of France’s primary rivalry from Spain to England.</p> 
                    <p>Despite this dramatic increase in French diplomatic activity, the expanse of the Kingdom's diplomatic geography has not been evaluated.<sup><a href="#FN1" id="r1" data-toggle="popover" data-content="There has been important research in French diplomatic history during the period. Lucien Bély, Espions et Ambassadeurs Au Temps de Louis XIV (Paris: Fayard, 1990), for instance, demonstrated the importance of diplomats to forming and international community in the late seventeenth century. Ellen R. Welch, A Theater of Diplomacy: International Relations and the Performing Arts in Early Modern France (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017), has demonstrated the importance of non-typical environments to diplomatic activities. De Lamar Jensen, “French Diplomacy and the Wars of Religion,” The Sixteenth Century Journal 5, no. 2 (October 1, 1974): 23–46, described to a limited extent the growth of French foreign policy during the Wars of Religion. There is much work on France's and indeed Europe's diplomatic history, which are both experienceing a resurgence of interest, but we still lack lack a full understanding of the geo-political realm France constructed and how it changed throughout this period.">1</sup></a> Traditionally Europe's geo-political limits were considered to be constrained to to the bounds of western Europe. Much of this interpretation is predicated on focusing entirely on the development of the permenant ambassador.<sup><a href="#FN2" id="r2" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See for instance, Garrett Mattingly, Renaissance Diplomacy (Cosimo Classics, 2009); and M. S. Anderson, The Origins of the Modern European State System, 1494-1618 (Longman Group, 1998), for the traditional interpetation.">2</a></sup> But recent research has demonstrated that diplomatic and international relations were maintained in many forms beyond dependence on permenant ambassadors. Women, renegades (Christian converts to Islam in the service of a Muslim state), even slaves, and other go-betweens all played prominent roles in maintaining foreign relations between states.<sup><a href="#FN3" id="r3" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sowerby and Hennings, Practices of Diplomacy in the Early Modern World c.1410-1800 (2017); Dursteler, Venetians in Constantinople: Nation, Identity, and Coexistence in the Early Modern Mediterranean, (2006), especially chap. 6; Rothman, Brokering Empire: Trans-Imperial Subjects between Venice and Istanbul (2012); Gürkan, “Espionage in the 16th Century Mediterranean: Secret Diplomacy, Mediterranean Go-Betweens and the Ottoman Habsburg Rivalry” (Ph.D. diss., Georgetown University, 2012); Malcolm, Agents of Empire: Knights, Corsairs, Jesuits and Spies in the Sixteenth-Century Mediterranean (2015); Watkins, “Toward a New Diplomatic History of Medieval and Early Modern Europe,” Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 38, no. 1 (2008): 1–14; van Gelder and Krstic, eds., “Cross-Confessional Diplomacy and Diplomatic Intermediaries in the Early Modern Mediterranean,” special issue, Journal of Early Modern History 19 (2015).">3</a></sup></p> 
                    <p>Mapping French Diplomacy seeks to track France's geo-political priorities during this dynamic period in the form of a born-digital monograph. It is focused on reconstructing France's geo-political world in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by mapping all the letters that French rulers wrote to foreign recipients. The project will begin with the Italian wars (1494-1559) and extend to the end of the Wars of Louis XIV (r.1643-1715). This period represents the period during which French foreign policy was predominated by its rivalry with the Habsburgs and speicifically the Spanish Habsburgs.</p>
                    <p>By mapping these letters, this project will produce a visual representation of France’s international priorities&mdash;what I refer to as its diplomatic geography&mdash;and how it changed over time. I will make two primary arguments in the project. One, the period from 1494 to 1715 represented a single cohesive period of political history, during which France maintained a standard set of priorities that were structural to their foreign policy system: the maintenance of cross-confessional alliances with the Protestant powers of Europe and the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Two, the region comprising the core of France’s foreign-policy priorities&mdash;or France’s diplomatic geography&mdash;was truly multi-continental, including Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. </p><br>
