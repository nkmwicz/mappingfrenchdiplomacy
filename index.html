                    <p>In 1494, the king of France, Charles VIII (r. 1483-1498), marched his army into the Italian peninsula to conquer Naples, which fell under Spain’s sovereignty to fulfill Charles VIII’s claim to the throne. The king’s actions set off a series of wars across Europe and the Mediterranean known as the Italian Wars (1494-1559). Almost all countries of the region were involved, including France, Spain, England, the Low Countries, the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the various Italian principalities, to name the most prominent states involved. This explosion of multi-continental war was a catalyst for a dramatic increase in French diplomacy and the development of a network of ambassadors scattered across Europe and the Mediterranean region in order to navigate the numerous alliances that permeated the conflict. For instance, France maintained one permanent ambassador abroad in 1515 but had established at least ten by 1547. France’s diplomatic outreach only expanded after 1559 as France navigated a series of crises until 1714: a series of religious civil wars in France from 1562 to 1629, France’s entrance into the Thirty Years War from 1630 until 1648, another civil war in France known as The Fronde from 1648 to 1659, and finally the wars of Louis XIV from 1661 to 1714. Throughout these conflicts, the Franco-Spanish rivalry played a prominent role in shaping their trajectories, and France's diplomatic network provided an essential tool for the French court to navigate these challenges as well as counter the threat Spain's influence compounded onto them. The end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1714 represented the end of an epoch as Louis XIV placed a member of his Bourbon dynasty on the Spanish throne, cementing the transition of France’s primary rivalry from Spain to England.</p> 

                    <p>Despite this dramatic increase in French diplomatic activity, the expanse of the kingdom's diplomatic geography has not been evaluated.<sup><a href="#FN1" id="r1" data-toggle="popover" data-content="There has been important research in French diplomatic history during the period. Bély, Espions et Ambassadeurs Au Temps de Louis XIV (1990), for instance, demonstrated the importance of diplomats to forming and international community in the late seventeenth century. Welch, A Theater of Diplomacy: International Relations and the Performing Arts in Early Modern France (2017), has demonstrated the importance of non-typical environments to diplomatic activities. Jensen, “French Diplomacy and the Wars of Religion,” Sixteenth Century Journal 5, no. 2 (1974): 23–46, described to a limited extent the growth of French foreign policy during the Wars of Religion. There is much work on France's and indeed Europe's diplomatic history, which are both experiencing a resurgence of interest, but we still lack lack a full understanding of the geo-political realm France constructed and how it changed throughout this period.">1</sup></a> Traditionally Europe's geo-political limits were considered to be constrained to the bounds of western Europe. Much of this interpretation is predicated on focusing entirely on the development of the permanent ambassador.<sup><a href="#FN2" id="r2" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See for instance, Garrett Mattingly, Renaissance Diplomacy (Cosimo Classics, 2009); and M. S. Anderson, The Origins of the Modern European State System, 1494-1618 (Longman Group, 1998), for the traditional interpetation.">2</a></sup> But recent research has demonstrated that diplomatic and international relations were maintained in many forms beyond dependence on permanent ambassadors. Women, renegades (Christian converts to Islam in the service of a Muslim state), other go-betweens, and even enslaved people all played prominent roles in maintaining foreign relations between states. As part of this revision of Europe's geo-political history, we have learned that Europe's political partnerships transcended the realm in which reciprocal resident ambassadors existed.<sup><a href="#FN3" id="r3" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sowerby and Hennings, Practices of Diplomacy in the Early Modern World c.1410-1800 (2017); Dursteler, Venetians in Constantinople: Nation, Identity, and Coexistence in the Early Modern Mediterranean, (2006), especially chap. 6; Rothman, Brokering Empire: Trans-Imperial Subjects between Venice and Istanbul (2012); Gürkan, “Espionage in the 16th Century Mediterranean: Secret Diplomacy, Mediterranean Go-Betweens and the Ottoman Habsburg Rivalry” (Ph.D. diss., Georgetown University, 2012); Malcolm, Agents of Empire: Knights, Corsairs, Jesuits and Spies in the Sixteenth-Century Mediterranean (2015); Watkins, “Toward a New Diplomatic History of Medieval and Early Modern Europe,” Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 38, no. 1 (2008): 1–14; van Gelder and Krstic, eds., “Cross-Confessional Diplomacy and Diplomatic Intermediaries in the Early Modern Mediterranean,” special issue, Journal of Early Modern History 19 (2015).">3</a></sup> In other words, by revising our understanding of how diplomacy was practiced, it has become clear that the presence of resident ambassadors did not adequately represent the constraints of Europe's or even any particular state's geo-political world.</p> 
                    
                    <p><cite>Mapping French Diplomacy</cite> re-evaluates France's geo-political world and priorities during this dynamic period in the form of a born-digital monograph. It is focused on reconstructing France's geo-political world in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by mapping all the letters that French rulers wrote to foreign recipients. In doing so, we can visualize which regions and states were at the forefront of French rulers'&mdash;and by extension the French court's since foreign policy and diplomacy were never individual pursuits.<sup><a href="#FN4" id="r4" data-toggle="popover" data-content="See for instance, Collins, “State Building in Early-Modern Europe: The Case of France,” Modern Asian Studies 31, no. 3 (1997): 605n2.">4</a></sup> The project will begin with the Italian wars (1494-1559) and extend to the end of the Wars of Louis XIV (r.1643-1715). This period represents the period during which French foreign policy was predominated by its rivalry with the Habsburgs and specifically the Spanish Habsburgs.</p>
                    <p>By mapping these letters, this project will produce a visual representation of France’s international priorities&mdash;what I refer to as its diplomatic geography&mdash;and how it changed over time. I will make two primary arguments in the project. One, the period from 1494 to 1715 represented a single cohesive period of political history, during which France maintained a standard set of priorities that were structural to their foreign policy system: the maintenance of cross-confessional alliances with the Protestant powers of Europe and the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Two, the region comprising the core of France’s foreign-policy priorities&mdash;or France’s diplomatic geography&mdash;was truly multi-continental, including Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.</p>
                    
                    <p><cite>Mapping French Diplomacy</cite> is a born-digital project specifically designed for the dynamic functionality of the web interface. The project will be separated into four parts with an introduction and conclusion: Part I, the Italian Wars (1494-1559); Part II, the Wars of Religion (1560-1629); Part III, the Thirty Years War and the Fronde (1610-1659); Part IV, the wars of Louis XIV (1660-1714). While these sections are organized in a linear fashion, the project itself will be designed to be investigated through non-linear pathways. Sections within these parts will emphasize both narrative and thematic elements of the project without organizing them within a pre-described hierarchy. For instance, Part II will be separated into sections on the letters of each author—Catherine de Medici, Charles IX (r. 1560-1574), Henri III, and Henri IV&mdash;but sections will also be dedicated to especially significant periods such as the years surrounding the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre when Catholics massacred Protestants throughout the country in 1572, and the period known as the wars of the Catholic League (1584-1598). A comparative section of the letters of the various rulers will also be included. By providing a non-hierarchical design, readers will be able to investigate the site in a flexible manner while not losing the argument. Finally, I will provide full access to a complete interactive leaflet.js map and network analysis tools containing all data from the letters in appendices, so researchers will be able to explore the data on their own as a research tool.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, each map/section is fully interactive. The links within the associated narrative change the data visualized on the map to reflect the point in the narrative. Moreover, each cluster of points can be expanded to see each individual point representing one letter sent from a French ruler to someone in that location (for the letters sections) or one ambassador present in that location during one year (for the ambassadors sections). If you click on a point, the map will open a popup that contains further information on the letter/diplomat the point represents, including basic information, including a short summary of the letter (in some cases) and letter topics (in some cases). Letter topics refer to other states or principalities (neither France, nor the location of the recipient of the letter) discussed in the letter.</p>
